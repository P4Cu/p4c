# p4c dot files

This is my dot files set. Some might be fairly old and not used but hopefully they might be useful to somebody (:

## custom apps

Unfortunately not everything is nicely packaged by Ubuntu (not at all or old version).

Never install bare apps! Use:

    checkinstall 
    checkinstall ninja install

* [mictray](https://github.com/Junker/mictray|mictray) Simple yet awesome microphone tray icon.
    - Build using meson+valac (gnome compiler).
* [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
* [autorandr](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr)
    - Mind to use the python version as it's newer!
    - Create your own screen configs.
* [i3status-rs](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust)
* [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud)
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) Shame Ubuntu! Such an old version.
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) Old version in repository.
* [xbanish](https://github.com/jcs/xbanish) Hide cursor while typing.

### Obsolete apps
* [spac+emacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) Actually I drop it in favor of VSCodium. Forgive me Mr. Stallman
* [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) Dropped in favor of i3status-rs. Much simpler and cleaner.
* [rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags) Dropped as I do most of my work in VSCode now and that was for VIM/emacs c++ completition/operations.
